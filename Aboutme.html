				<h1>Introduction </h1>
				<p>I am a novice software engineer who enjoys <strong>building interesting web features</strong>, <a href="http://www.esri.com/what-is-gis"><strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</strong></a>, and <strong>fitness</strong>. I currently work for <a href="http://www.caldwellcompliance.com/">Caldwell Compliance</a> ensuring that wireless towers and colocations follow local and federal regulations. In addition to working full time, I coach at <a href= "http://recsports.berkeley.edu/facilities/rec-centers/golden-bear-rec-center/">Golden Bear Gymnastics</a>.
				</p>
				<p>As a millenial, I have seen how technology has grown to improve our lifestyles and businesses of the modern economy. Geolocation and database systems that interpret our data are subjects that fascinate me.

				<h1> Where I'm From
				</h1>
				<p>I was born in Salinas, but have lived most of my life in the Bay Area. Walking along its levies, playing in its sports complexes, and attending the yearly Arts and Wine festival made some of the highlights of my upbringing. I graduated from UC Davis <strong>with Honors</strong> in the Environmental Science and Management major with a GIS focus and Watershed Science minor.

				<h1>More About Me
				</h1>
				<p>I've been developing early symptoms of wanderlust recently. I've planned out about a <strong>DOZEN</strong> trips over the next several months to really get exploring other cities.
				</p>

				<h3>What are your favorite hobbies?
				</h3>
				<p>There are very few sports I don't enjoy. Just in the last two months, I've rock climbed, played soccer, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, and done gymnastics. Competition can be an addiction!
				</p>
			
				<h3>What's your dream job?
				</h3>
				<p>My dream job would be one in which I was managing teams of both technical and non-technical employees, and faced frequent problem solving that involved taking a creative vision and figuring out how to bring that vision to reality.
				</p>
		
				<h3>What's your programming background?
				</h3>
				<p>I've gone through a few online free resources in HTML/CSS, coded in Python in college, and created a few programs in Python that run through ArcGIS. 
				</p>
				<p>My background is primarily environmental, having worked for a federal agency, in research, and for an independent consulting firm.

				<h3>What music have you been listening to recently?
				</h3>
			  	<p>I've been listineing to chillstep and workout/electronic playlists on <a href="8tracks.com/">8Tracks</a>, one of my favorite apps! The playlists are often <strong>EXACTLY</strong> what I am in the mood to hear.
